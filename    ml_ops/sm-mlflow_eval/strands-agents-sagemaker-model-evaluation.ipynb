    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored how to build AI agents using Strands Agents SDK with models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI endpoints, while leveraging SageMaker Managed MLflow for comprehensive agent observability and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Built a basic Strands Agent** using Amazon Bedrock as the model provider\n",
    "2. **Deployed a Qwen model** from SageMaker JumpStart as an inference endpoint\n",
    "3. **Integrated SageMaker models** with Strands Agents for greater infrastructure control\n",
    "4. **Set up MLflow observability** for automatic agent tracing and monitoring\n",
    "5. **Implemented A/B testing with evaluation** comparing model variants using:\n",
    "   - Tool Selection Accuracy\n",
    "   - Task Completion Rate\n",
    "   - Response Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Description | Use Case |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| Tool Selection | Verifies the agent used the expected tool (e.g., calculator) | Agent capability assessment |\n",
    "| Correctness | Checks if response contains expected facts | Accuracy measurement |\n",
    "| Relevance to Query | Evaluates if response directly addresses the user's question | Response quality assessment |\n",
